## FingerSaber
Recommend chaning to 120Hz refersh rate for smoother gameplay.

__IMPORTANT__

Will Not work without Hand-tracking permissions! Patch the game with hand-tracking permissions enabled.  
This can be done e.g. using MBF: tools tab -> change permissions -> "Hand tracking" -> repatch game

__Description__

Miniature Beat Saber! A mod that uses Quest hand tracking on Beat Saber. Imagine yourself as a giant using your fingers as sabers! You can assign sabers to any finger, even on the same hand - customize this in the mod settings.
For a more classic experience, you can toggle the "Hands-Only Mode" to play with just your hands instead of fingers.
Should work with most mods, including Noodle Extension and Multiplayer.

__Note__

Disabled score submission (temporarily) when mod is enabled.
